</div>

This repo hosts a collection of developer examples and [sample projects](https://docs.jacobirobotics.com/solutions/sample-projects/index.html) for the Jacobi libraries. Let us know if you'd like to see more!


## Jacobi Motion Library

Bite-size examples in `motion/` on how to load projects from Studio, add obstacles on-the-fly, plan different types of motions, or calculate forward and inverse kinematics.


## Jacobi Robot Drivers

A few examples in `drivers/` on how to read the current state of the robot, move along a pre-calculated trajectory or directly to a goal position, and control the robot's I/O.


## Jacobi Vision Library

A few examples in `vision/` on how to communicate with Studio to simulate cameras, read real sensor data from an Intel RealSense or Photoneo PhoXi camera.


## Sample Projects

More complete example projects in `projects/` showing the capabilities of our libraries for more practical applications. These are written in Python and oftentimes using the `asyncio` package to simplify programming concurrent tasks.
