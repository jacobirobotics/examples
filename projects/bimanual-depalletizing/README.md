# Bimanual Depalletizing

Robotic depalletizing is crucial in the logistics industry, enabling efficient use-cases like distribution or order fulfillment. Fast motion planning can significantly reduce cycle times and boost productivity. Jacobi's software can plan bimanual motions, enabling simultaneous manipulation of items, optimizing throughput and minimizing cycle times. This project features three operational modes: Bimanual Mode, where both arms plan and execute pick-and-place actions simultaneously; Single-Arm Dynamic Mode, where one arm's motion is planned first and the other follows while considering the first arm’s trajectory, with both arms executing their motions at the same time; and Single-Arm Interlock Mode, where one arm’s motion is planned while the other remains static, and the trajectories are executed sequentially.
