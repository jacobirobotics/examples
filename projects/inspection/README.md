# Inspection

Robotic quality inspection systems utilize robots to examine and assess products on a production line according to predefined criteria, such as size, shape, color, and surface defects. These systems have gained popularity in manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution facilities due to their ability to provide faster and more consistent inspections, thereby improving overall product quality and reducing human error. However, the increasing demand for 6 or 7-axis robots, while offering enhanced flexibility in handling complex inspections, also introduces greater complexity in programming and optimization, leading to higher costs for engineering, onsite support, and reprogramming.

In this tutorial, we introduce a short program created using the Jacobi platform, designed to be easily configurable for robotic quality inspection.
