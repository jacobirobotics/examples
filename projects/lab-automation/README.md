# Laboratory Automation

In laboratory automation, bimanual robots are utilized to perform complex tasks that require the coordination of two robotic arms, such as handling delicate samples, operating instruments, or transferring materials between devices. The adoption of bimanual robots in labs can significantly improve efficiency and precision, reducing human error and increasing throughput in research and testing processes. However, the advanced capabilities of these robots also introduce greater complexity in programming and optimization, leading to higher costs for engineering, system integration, and ongoing maintenance. Here we introduce a short program created using the Jacobi platform, designed to be easily configurable for lab automation tasks involving dual-arm robots.
